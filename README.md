##Credit
This Mod was made by me, but a lot of the code I learnt from looking at other Fabric mods, in particular
[ExtraAlchemy](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/extra-alchemy) by zabi94 and [ElementalCreepersRefabricated](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/elemental-creepers-refabricated) by Luligabi1

Also [TechnoVisions youtube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3n-lKS-MYlunVtErgzSFZg) which got me into this in the first place
